# Approximate Delta Functions

This task is divided into two parts
part1: Generate window functions
part2: Use window functions to approximate the delta function

Project Part1 Description:
I proposed a tool for transforming functions into window functions, which are
zero-valued except a specific interval, and visualizing the resulting window functions.
When the interval is around zero, resulting functions will become low-pass filters.

Project Part2 Description:
